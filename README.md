# camel-micrsoft-dynamics-customer
An event-driven integration that listens to Microsoft Dynamics events via Solace, retrieves the complete dataset, and transforms it into the EDM (Enterprise Data Model) format.

**Technologies**
- Solace PUBSUB
- Microsoft Dynamics
- Apache Camel - Java
- JSLT - JSON Query and Transformation Language

Here’s what it does:
- Subscribes to events indicating changes or updates in Microsoft Dynamics
- Makes targeted API calls to Dynamics to fetch the complete setup data
- Transforms the raw data using JSLT into our Enterprise Data Model (EDM)
- Publishes the enriched and standardized data downstream for consumption

🛠️ What makes it powerful?
Both the queries to Dynamics and the JSLT transformations are externally configurable, allowing rapid updates without code changes. This gives us flexibility, reusability, and quick adaptation to changing business needs.

This event-driven approach ensures:
✅ Real-time synchronization
✅ Clean separation of concerns
✅ Scalable, loosely-coupled architecture
✅ Improved data consistency across platforms

Whether it’s master data, configurations, or reference entities – this pattern helps us keep our enterprise data aligned, timely, and standardized.
